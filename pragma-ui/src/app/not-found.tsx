          You told your friends you werenâ€™t bringing your phone, to try and
          experience what travel was like back in the day. You bought a map, a
          bottle of water and a camera just for this trip. But the map was from
          2005, the landscape had changed and no one had verified the map. So
          here you are, in the middle of a large field, which the map continues
          to claim is a local grocer.
