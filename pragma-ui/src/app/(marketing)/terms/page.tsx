          users to access open source documentation, content, and services,
          including (without limitation) resources, data and computation
          services provided by decentralized networks of node operators that are
          selling usage of specific data via data feeds, APIs and various
          payment capabilities directly to smart contracts integrating Pragma
          software (Pragma Network”), and information and resources for the
          Pragma Network community (collectively such services, information,
          APIs, and resources related to the Pragma Network are referred to as
          the “Services”). Some Services offered by us or other participants in
          the Pragma Network require payment or otherwise involve the use of an
          underlying blockchain or other decentralized or permissioned
          infrastructure (“Distributed Ledger Technology”), which may require
          that you pay a fee, such as “gas” charges on the Ethereum network or
          other applicable blockchain network, for the computational resources
          required to perform a transaction on the particular Distributed Ledger
          Technology (such payments and fees, “Charges”). You acknowledge and
          agree that the Foundation has no control over any Distributed Ledger
          Technology transactions, the method of payment of any Charges, if
          applicable, or any actual payments of Charges, if applicable.
          Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the
          applicable Distributed Ledger Technology network tokens stored at your
          Distributed Ledger Technology-compatible wallet address (“Distributed
          Ledger Technology Address”) to complete any transaction on the Pragma
          Network or the Distributed Ledger Technology before initiating such a
          transaction.

          representatives, suppliers, licensors and contractors (collectively,
          Protected Parties”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action,
          proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense,
          including without limitation reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, arising
          out of or relating to your use of, or conduct in connection with, the
          Website, Services, the Pragma Network or Pragma future Tokens,
          Distributed Ledger Technology assets associated with your Distributed
          Ledger Technology Address, any other digital assets, any Feedback or

          Applicable Law or regulations; any claims made by or against the
          Protected Parties by other members of the organization or entity on
          whose behalf you may be using the Website or Services; or your
          infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or
          entity. If you are obligated to indemnify any Protected Party, the
          Foundation (or, at its discretion, the applicable Protected Party)
          will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or
          proceeding and to determine whether the Foundation wishes to settle,
          and if so, on what terms. <br /> <br />
          <h5 className="text-mint">8. DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS</h5> <br /> The
          Foundation seeks to encourage the continued growth and success of the
          Pragma Network as a public good. The Foundation does not operate a
          virtual currency or derivatives exchange platform or offer trade
          execution or clearing services and therefore has no oversight,
          involvement, or control with respect to your transactions, including
          Pragma future Token purchases and sales. You are responsible for
          complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your
          transactions, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange
          Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity
          Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and the federal securities laws
          and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and
          Exchange Commission (“SEC”). You understand that the Foundation is not
          registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC or any financial regulatory
          authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved
          the use of the open-source software utilized by the Pragma Network.
          The Website, the Services, and the Pragma open-source software do not
          constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity,
          security or other asset. The Foundation is not acting as an investment
          adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person. The Foundation
          does not own or control the underlying software protocols that are
          used in connection with the Pragma future Tokens. In general, the
          underlying protocols are open-source and anyone can use, copy, modify,
          and distribute them. the Foundation is not responsible for the
          operation of the underlying protocols, and the Foundation makes no
          guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability. To the
          maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Website and the
          Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on
          behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and
          we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations,
          conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
          legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in
          law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without
          limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of
          merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a
          particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability,
          accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights.
          Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that
          the Website or the Services (including any related data) will be
          uninterrupted, available at any particular time or error-free.
          Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Website or the Service
          are correctable or will be corrected. You acknowledge that your User
          Code or User Content may be made public and your data on the Website
          or through the Services may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or
          temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and agree that, to
          the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will not be
          liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks,
          software failures, misconduct by third-party service providers on the
          Pragma Network, viruses or other technologically harmful materials
          (including those which may infect your computer equipment), protocol
          changes by third party providers, Internet outages, force majeure
          events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or
          other causes either within or outside our control. The disclaimer of
          implied warranties contained in these Terms may not apply if and to
          the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the
          Applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside. <br /> <br />
          <h5 className="text-mint">
            9. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES
          </h5>{" "}
          <br /> In no event will the Foundation, together with any Protected
          Party, be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive,
          exemplary, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever
          (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, information,
          revenue, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit)
          arising out of or in connection with the Website, the Services and the
          Pragma Network (and any of their content and functionality), any

          any other theory of liability, and whether or not any Protected Party
          has been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility
          of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential
          purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy nor is the Foundation in
          any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions

          <br /> <br />
          <h5 className="text-mint">10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5> <br /> In
          no event will the Protected Parties&apos; aggregate liability arising
          out of or in connection with the Website, the Services and the Pragma
          Network (and any of their content and functionality), any performance
          or non-performance of the Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology

          twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise
          to the claim for liability. <br /> <br />
          <h5 className="text-mint">11. RELEASE</h5> <br /> To the extent
          permitted by applicable law, in consideration for being allowed to use
          the Website, the Services and/or the Pragma Network, you and all other
          members of the entity or organization on whose behalf you are using
          the Website or Services and/or the Pragma Network hereby release and
          forever discharge the Foundation and all Protected Parties from, and

          or Pragma Network users or any third-party services). YOU HEREBY WAIVE
          ANY APPLICABLE PROVISION IN LAW OR REGULATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE
          FOREGOING, WHICH STATES IN SUBSTANCE: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT
          EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST

          <h5 className="text-mint">
            12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
          </h5>{" "}
          <br />
          Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
          arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits
          the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of
          arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In
          addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a
          jury trial. You and the Foundation agree that any dispute arising out
          of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and
          the Foundation and that any dispute will be resolved solely through
          individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration,
          class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Except
          for small claims disputes in which you or the Foundation seeks to
          bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county
          or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes in which
          you or the Foundation seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for
          the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and the
          Foundation waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute
          arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in
          court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against the
          Foundation or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first
          contact the Foundation and attempt to resolve the claim informally by
          sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to the Foundation by
          email at{" "}
          <Link
            className="text-mint underline"
            href={"mailto:legal@pragma.build"}
          >
            legal@pragma.build
          </Link>{" "}
          . The Notice must include your name, residence address, email address,
          and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim and
          set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be
          similar in form to that described above. If you and the Foundation
          cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days
          after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the
          dispute to binding arbitration administered by the American
          Arbitration Association (“AAA”), or, under the limited circumstances
          set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to AAA will be
          resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one
          arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Geneva,
          Switzerland, in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules
          (“AAA Rules”). The most recent version of the AAA Rules are available
          on the AAA website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You
          either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the AAA
          Rules or waive your opportunity to read the AAA Rules and waive any
          claim that the AAA Rules are unfair or should not apply for any
          reason. You and the Foundation agree that the enforceability of this
          Section 12 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the
          Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the
          maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA,
          these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive
          authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding
          any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
          in court, including the power to determine the question of
          arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual
          arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&apos;s
          claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or
          preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. The
          arbitrator, the Foundation, and you will maintain the confidentiality
          of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but
          not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for
          purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator
          will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard
          confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of
          confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is
          necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the
          merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary
          remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration
          award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is
          otherwise required by law or judicial decision. You and the Foundation
          agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing
          fee and the Foundation will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For
          any arbitration initiated by the Foundation, the Foundation will pay
          all AAA fees and costs. You and the Foundation agree that the courts
          of Geneva sitting in Switzerland have exclusive jurisdiction over any
          appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. Any claim arising
          out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within
          one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently
          barred, which means that you and the Foundation will not have the
          right to assert the claim. You have the right to opt out of binding
          arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of
          this Section 12 by emailing us at{" "}
          <Link

            legal@pragma.build
          </Link>{" "}
          . In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full
          name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of
          binding arbitration. If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be
          unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or
          unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms, severance of the
          unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on
          the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties&apos; ability to
          compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis
          under this Section 12, and to the extent that any claims must
          therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or
          representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court
          of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties
          agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the
          outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part
          of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking
          public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the
          extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the
          remainder of this Section 12 will be enforceable. By opting out of
          binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in
          accordance with Section 12. <br /> <br />
          <h5 className="text-mint">13. GOVERNING LAW</h5> <br /> The
          interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related
          to these Terms, the Website or the Services, will be governed by and
          construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, as
          applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles
          (whether of Switzerland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
          the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that
          we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of
          our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction.
          With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to
          arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in Geneva will have
          exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such
          courts. <br /> <br />
          <h5 className="text-mint">13. RISK FACTORS</h5> <br /> You acknowledge
          the following serious risks to any use of the Website or the Services
          or the Pragma future Token and expressly agree to not hold any
          Protected Parties liable should any of the following risks occur:

            The Website or the Services or the Pragma future Token could be
            impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions,
            which could impede or limit the ability of the Foundation to
            continue to develop the Website or Services, or which could impede
            or limit your ability to use the Website or Services or the Pragma
            future Token.
            <br /> <br />
            <span className="font-bold text-mint opacity-50">
              - Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Pragma Networks:
            </span>{" "}
            It is possible that alternative Pragma-based networks could be
            established, which utilize the same open source code and open source
            protocol underlying the Pragma Network and/or Services. The Pragma
            Network may compete with these alternative Pragma-based networks,
            which could potentially negatively impact the Pragma Network, the
            Services and/or the Pragma future Token. <br /> <br />{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-mint opacity-50">
              - Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Pragma Network or
              Distributed Applications:
            </span>{" "}
            It is possible that the Pragma Network will not be used by a large
            number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations
            and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and
            development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest
            could impact the development of the Pragma Network and potential
            uses of Pragma future Tokens. The Foundation cannot predict the
            success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third
            parties. <br /> <br />{" "}

            You recognize that the Website, Services and the Pragma Network are
            under development and may undergo significant changes over time. You
            acknowledge that any expectations regarding the form and
            functionality of the Pragma Network held by you may not be met for
            any number of reasons including a change in the design and
            implementation plans, specifications and execution of the
            implementation of the Website, Services or the Pragma Network.
            <br /> <br />
            <span className="font-bold text-mint opacity-50">
              - Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Pragma Network Core
              Infrastructure Software:
            </span>{" "}
            The Website, Services and the Pragma Network rest on open-source
            software, and there is a risk that the Protected Parties, or other
            third parties not directly affiliated with the Foundation, may
            introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements
            of the Website, Services or the Pragma Network causing the system to
            lose Pragma future Tokens stored in one or more of your accounts or
            other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens. Furthermore,
            despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Website,
            Services and the Pragma Network, the Website, Services and the
            Pragma Network may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be
            adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the
            Website, Services, the Pragma Network and Pragma future Tokens.

              - Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of
              Cryptography:
            </span>{" "}
            Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can
            advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances
            such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to
            cryptocurrencies and the Website, Services and the Pragma Network
            which could result in the theft or loss of Pragma future Tokens. To
            the extent within its control and otherwise possible, the Foundation
            intends to update the protocol underlying the Services and the
            Pragma Network to account for any advances in cryptography and to
            incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the
            future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will
            be made in a timely or successful manner.

            Any blockchain used for the Services and/or the Pragma Network may
            be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to:
            double-spend attacks, reorganizations, majority mining power
            attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and work race condition attacks.
            Any successful attacks present a risk to the Services, the Pragma
            Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions,
            and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract

              Application Processing Power of the Services and the Pragma

            If the Services and/or the Pragma Network are rapidly adopted, the
            demand for transaction processing and distributed application
            computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the
            rate with which Pragma services can be provided. Under such a
            scenario, the Services and Pragma Network could become destabilized,
            due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In
            turn, this could dampen interest in the Services, the Pragma Network
            and Pragma future Tokens. Insufficiency of computational resources
            and an associated rise in the price of Pragma future Tokens could
            result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational
            resources to run their distributed applications. This could result
            in lost revenues and disruption or halting of business operations.

              - Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws:
            </span>{" "}
            The Pragma Network, and by extension the Website and Services, may
            be subject to a variety of international laws and regulations,
            including those with respect to financial or securities regulations,
            consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content
            regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection,
            intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and
            trade secret laws), defamation, and others. Such laws and
            regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and
            regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations
            affecting the Pragma Network could be enacted. As the Website,
            Services and Pragma Network evolve, we may be subject to new laws,
            and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws
            and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert
            a significant portion of the Foundation&apos;s attention and
            resources or restrict the way the Pragma may operate. If we fail to
            comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could receive
            negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which
            could adversely impact the Website, Services, and the Pragma Network
            and Pragma future Tokens. Additionally, Pragma node operators of the
            Pragma Network may be subject to industry specific laws and
            regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails
            to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other
            applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or
            licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise
            expanded, the Pragma Network and/or Pragma future Tokens could be
            adversely impacted.

              - Market Risks:
            </span>{" "}
            Pragma future Tokens are intended to be used solely in connection
            with the Pragma Network, and we do not support or otherwise
            facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Pragma
            future Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using
            Pragma future Tokens, and could therefore create Pragma risk to
            Pragma future Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of Pragma
            future Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such
            exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no
            regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related
            risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an
            external exchange value to Pragma future Tokens (e.g., as
            denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be
            extremely volatile and diminish to zero.

              - Specific Risks Relating to Value and Function of Pragma future
              Tokens:
            </span>{" "}
            The utility benefits of using Pragma future Tokens to access
            services provided by Pragma node operators can only materialize
            through user-driven adoption over time. Such adoption depends on a
            variety of factors, including the pace of user adoption, the organic
            community-driven expansion of the Pragma Network. As such, the
            extent of user adoption is entirely outside of our control and
            cannot be stated with any certainty. The price of Pragma future
            Tokens may fluctuate in response to competitive and market
            conditions affecting the general supply of and demand for
            user-requested services. These conditions are beyond our control.
            The value of Pragma future Tokens on the Pragma Network may be lower
            than the price at which it was purchased. The utility of Pragma
            future Tokens, and any value associated with that utility, will
            depend on the ability of the Pragma Network to adequately facilitate
            user-requested services. Inadequate supply may result in such
            services taking more time, while inadequate demand may make it
            difficult to obtain services, both of which may discourage
            participation in the Pragma Network. The compensation for providing
            Pragma node services in the Pragma Network will depend on the resale
            price for the Pragma future Tokens received for such services, which
            may be lower than the compensation that might have been received
            through other arrangements. No promises of future performance or
            value are or will be made with respect to Pragma future Token,
            including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing
            payments, and no guarantee that Link Token will hold any particular
            value.
